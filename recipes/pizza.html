    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A true Italian recipe that everyone will enjoy. You can use ready made pizza bread to make this quick...or use your own recipe for a hand tossed pizza, either way, you're sure to enjoy! The escarole does not need to be cooked ahead of time...it cooks right on the pizza. Also, I think with this pizza, the less sauce the better.</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (12 inch) individual ready made pizza crusts</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>5 leaves escarole, rinsed and dried</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
